        A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/,[1] US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/,
        French: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie
        pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the
        French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[2] Croissants are named for their
        historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and
        folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
        technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
        texture, similar to a puff pastry.
